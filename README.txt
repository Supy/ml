Name: Machine Learning Assignment 1 - Reinforcement learning: Neuro-Evolution.



Description: 

	- This Program is an extension from the provided mine-sweeper framework.
	- An evolutionary algorithm (EA) is used to adapt Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) according 
	to their fitness value which is calculated through reinforcement learning.


Instructions: 
	- Unzip the contents of ML1_FRGMIC005.
	- Run the Visual Studio Solution file
